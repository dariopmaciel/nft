# nft

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

With these apps, I tried to learn code stacking, animations, blur effects and use of image assets list. Due to crash in "GLIBC_2.33" - ubuntu 22.04 some effects did not load fully.

A downgrade will be necessary to correction.
